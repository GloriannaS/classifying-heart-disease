# Classifying Heart Disease
In this guided project, we will demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of Logistic Regression modeling in Python. We will be working with a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). This dataset contains medical information related to heart disease, collected by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

Our objective is to build a Logistic Regression model capable of predicting whether a patient has heart disease. By doing so, we will highlight the practical applications of Logistic Regression and show how it can provide valuable insights that impact health and everyday decision-making.

This guided project is provided by Dataquest. They have already cleaned the dataset for use in this project, so we will work with their version to follow along more closely.
